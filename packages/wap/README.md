# Web app

The web app is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) app built using [Expo](https://expo.io/). It's a mobile app that can be run on both iOS and Android devices, and can be used online in any web browser.

## Getting started

A `.env` file is required to run the app. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template to populate the environment variables.

To run the app, run `yarn start`. This will start the Expo development server. You can then run the app on your device by scanning the QR code in the terminal, or by opening the app in a web browser.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble using expo, run the command with the `-c` argument to clear the cache. For example, `yarn start -c`.

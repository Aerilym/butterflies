          <h3>Why "Eros"?</h3>
          <p>
            Eros is the name of the Greek god of love and desire. As a tool for managing a dating
            app, the name "Eros" could be seen as fitting because it relates to the central focus of
            the app, which is facilitating romantic connections between people.
